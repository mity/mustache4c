## WARNING

This is still work in very embryonal stage. No feature is fully functional
or even recognizable.

One day, it shall hopefully grow and mature into fully developed and effective
C {{mustache}} parser, intended mainly for integration into other code rather
then as a toolset of command line utilities.
